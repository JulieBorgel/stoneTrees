\title{Solve multiple bootstrap Minimum Steiner Tree problems (aka Steiner Forest procedure)}
\format{R6Class \code{nodeCentricSteinerForestProblem} Construct an object representation of the bootstraped Steiner Tree process (aka Steiner Forest routine)}
\usage{
nodeCentricSteinerForestProblem
}
\description{
Given a set of seeds/fixed terminals a Minimum Steiner Tree can be found. One might well be interested in studying the common nodes that
would be included with, say, just 50% of the seed set. This process is known as a 'bootstrap' in statistics and this class looks to
repeatedly sample seeds to produce a consensus set of MStTP solutions. Sub-solutions can also be collected, albeit at an increased burden on the
solver (and therefore dramatically increasing the time).
}
\details{
This class is derived from *subOptimalSteinerProblem* and in turn *nodeCentricSteinerTreeProblem*: all methods available in the superclass are available here. The difference is that after
each acceptable solution is found, the solution is a.) stored in a bootstrap solution pool and b.) used to generate a 'novelty' constraint on future solutions. For each bootstrap run, the solution pool
is flushed and the process re-rerun. In the end, all of the boostrap solutions are in the bootstrap solution pool.

\describe{
   \item{\code{new(network, solverChoice = chooseSolver(), verbose = TRUE, solverTimeLimit = 300, solverTrace = as.integer(verbose), solutionTolerance = 0)}}{Constructor for the nodeCentricSteinerForestProblem class. Note the loss of 'presolveGraph'; the repeated resampling of fixed terminal nodes prevents this.}
   \item{\code{sampleMultipleBootstrapSteinerSolutions(nBootstraps = 5, maxItr = 0, resamplingProbability= 0.5)}}{Run the bootstrap procedure nBootstraps times, each time resampling seeds with pSuccess = resamplingProbability, collecting degenerate or suboptimal solutions for maxItr times.}
   \item{\code{getBootstrapSolutionPoolGraphs(collapseSols = TRUE)}}{Either return a list of solutions within tolerance (collapseSols = FALSE) or pool all solutions together and return a single graph (collapseSols = TRUE, defaults)}
   \item{...}{Other methods are self explanatory and likely uninteresting to a general user}

#Prepare a simple seed-based Steiner sampling in a reasonable sized network

fixedTerminalLymphomaGraph <- lymphomaGraph

# Example of solving *just* the single-solution Minimum Steiner Tree Problem
MStTPsingle <- nodeCentricSteinerTreeProblem$new(fixedTerminalLymphomaGraph)
MStTPsingle$findSingleSteinerSolution()

#Solve multiple bootstrap Steiner Trees (Steiner Forest)
SteinFor <- nodeCentricSteinerForestProblem$new(fixedTerminalLymphomaGraph)

#Run two bootstrap routines (resample fixed terminals and solve) and 
#ALSO run the sub-optimal solution searcher thrice
SteinFor$sampleMultipleBootstrapSteinerSolutions(nBootstraps = 2, maxItr = 3)
## Takes around a minute using RGLPK as the solver
